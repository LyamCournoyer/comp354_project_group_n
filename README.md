# Interpreter
The intepreter executes files.

It was designed using python 3.10.
## How to run
There is a test file _interpreter/test_file.txt_ that can be used (any file can be passed)

`python ./interpreter/interpreter.py --file interpreter/test_file.txt`

# Editor
Currently pretty basic and based off of https://pythonguides.com/python-tkinter-editor#Python_Tkinter_code_editor
Only minor changes have been done to be integrated with the interpreter.

## How to run
`python ./editor/editor.py`
